# User Stories
The quiz starts after clicking the Start button. Then, the quiz page appears with the question, question's picture, choices, progress flags, timer and a reset button.
The picture and the question appeared besides each other, the choices are 3 and they are below the question and question's picture. 
The progress flags are at the bottom right. Each question has a flag. Flags are white circles, when the user chooses the correct answer, the flag color turned into green, when the answer is wrong, the flag color turns into red. 
The timer is 15 second and when the time is up, the answer for that question will be considered as a wrong answer.
When the user finished the quiz, by reaching the last question, a score page will pop up above the quiz page showing the score (correct answers/total number of questions). If the user answered all questions correctly, a cheering sound will be played and ballons background will be showed. If the user answered all the questions wrongly, a failure sound will be played.
The reset button will reset the flags, timer and score, then move to the go back to the first question again.
